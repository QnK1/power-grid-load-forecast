# Power grid load forecasting

## Introduction
In this project we aim to replicate the results of the paper [Bak, M., & Bielecki, A. (2007). Neural systems for short-term forecasting of electric power load. In B. Ribeiro, B. Beliczynski, A. Dz ielinski, & M. Iwanowski (Eds.), ADAPTIVE AND NATURAL COMPUTING ALGORITHMS, PT 2 (Vol. 4432, p. 133). Springer Nature.](https://link-1springer-1com-1nyztljwx006c.wbg2.bg.agh.edu.pl/book/10.1007/978-3-540-71629-7), which explores neural networkâ€“based methods for short-term power grid load prediction. In addition to reproducing the published results, we attempt to develop and evaluate a custom forecasting approach to compare its performance against the original models.
